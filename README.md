# Music-Projects
Ease-of-Access Repo for storing and transferring LMMS project files.
Notice, some tracks are unplayable because you will likely not have instruments/sounds saved that I used to make these tracks. These are raw lmms files, meaning they require the source of all audio files used in the tracks to allow music to play accordingly.

The only things you need to know:
-----------------------------------
1. Projects with the label "Rusty" in them are completed songs.
2. Projects labeled only with a digit are current works in progress.
3. Projects with a label such as "electro," "classical," or "vg" 
   are songs that I have tossed and are labeled based on genre.
4. You are free to play with these projects as much as you like, but you may never claim any of these projects as your own.
