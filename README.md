# Music-Projects
Ease-of-Access Repo for storing and transferring LMMS project files.

The only things you need to know:
-----------------------------------
1. Songs with the label "Rusty" in them are completed songs.
2. Songs labeled only with a digit are current works in progress.
3. songs with a label such as "electro," "classical," or "vg" 
   are songs that I have tossed and are labeled based on genre.
